\section*{Introduction}

The aim of this visualisation is to demonstrate the process of Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm using 
a simple graph with weighted edges, where colours of vertices and edges change based on the different stages
of the algorithm.

\section*{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}

Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm is a method for finding the shortest distance from a given
source node to all other nodes in a simple, weighted graph \cite{djikstra1959note}. The version of the algorithm
used in this visualisation is the original version, as opposed to min-priority queue implementation
\cite{fredman1987fibonacci}.
